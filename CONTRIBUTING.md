# Contributing to SparkApp

Welcome to **SparkApp-team** 👋  
This document explains how we work on this project together.

SparkApp is a small habit tracker built with:

- **Backend:** Java + Spring Boot (in `backend/`)
- **iOS app:** Swift + SwiftUI (in `ios/`)

The goal is to practice real-world collaboration: issues, branches, pull requests, reviews.

---

## 1. How we work

- All work happens through **issues** and **pull requests**.
- We do **not** push directly to `main`.
- Each task should be **small** (1–3 hours).
- We try to keep code **simple and readable**.

If something is unclear, we ask in chat instead of guessing for days.

## 2. Repository structure

```text
